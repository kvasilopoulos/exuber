Testing for and dating periods of explosive dynamics (exuberance) in time series 
using the univariate and panel recursive unit root tests proposed by [Phillips et al. (2015)](https://doi.org/10.1111/iere.12132) and [Pavlidis et al. (2016)]( https://doi.org/10.1007/s11146-015-9531-2). The recursive least-squares algorithm utilizes the matrix inversion lemma to avoid matrix inversion which results in significant speed improvements. Simulation of a variety of periodically-collapsing bubble processes.

### Overview

Testing for explosive dynamics is comprised of two distinct parts :

* Estimation
* Critical Values

**Some Context:** Conventional testing techniques compute critical values,and p-values from a standard distribution, where the user does not need to specify critical values explicitly. However, the recent literature in explosive dynamics require the use of non-standard distributions, which require the use of techniques that sample empirical distributions in order to calculate the critical values.

#### Estimation 

The cornerstone function of the package is:

* `radf()`: Recursive Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test.

This function offers a vectorized estimation (i.e. single and/or multiple time-series)
for individual and panel estimation. The estimation can parse data from multiple classes and handle dates as index.

#### Critical Values

There are several options for generating critical values:

* `radf_mc_cv()`: Monte Carlo
* `radf_wb_cv()`: Wild Bootstrap
* `radf_sb_cv()`: Sieve Bootstrap (Panel)

On default `exuber` will use Monte Carlo simulated critical values if no other option is provided. The package offers these critical values in the form of `data` (up to 600 observations), that are obtained with the `mc_cv()` function.

### Analysis

For the analysis you should include both the output from estimation (`object`) and critical values (`cv`). The below methods break the process into small simple steps:

* `summary()` summarizes the model.
* `diagnostics()` shows which series reject the null hypothesis .
* `datestamp()` computes the origination, termination and duration of episodes (if any).

These combined provide a comprehensive analysis on the exuberant behavior of the model.

### Installation

```{r installation, eval = FALSE}
# Install release version from CRAN
