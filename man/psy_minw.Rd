\usage{
psy_minw(n)

psy_ds(n, rule = 1, delta = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{A positive integer. The sample size.}

\item{rule}{Rule 1 corresponds to log(T), while rule 2 log(T)/T}

\item{delta}{Frequency-dependent parameter}
}
\description{
\code{psy_minw} proposes a minimum window and \code{psy_ds} proposes a rule of
thumb to exclude periods of exuberance.
}
\details{
\code{delta } depends on the frequency of the data and the minimal
duration condition. For example, for a 30-year period, we set arbitrarily duration
to exceed periods such as one year. Then, delta should is 0.7 for yearly data
and 5 for monthly data.
