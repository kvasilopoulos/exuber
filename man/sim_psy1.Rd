\usage{
sim_psy1(
  n,
  te = 0.4 * n,
  tf = 0.15 * n + te,
  c = 1,
  alpha = 0.6,
  sigma = 6.79,
  seed = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{A positive integer specifying the length of the simulated output series.}

\item{te}{A scalar in (0, tf) specifying the observation in which the bubble originates.}

\item{tf}{A scalar in (te, n) specifying the observation in which the bubble collapses.}

\item{c}{A positive scalar determining the autoregressive coefficient in the explosive regime.}

\item{alpha}{A positive scalar in (0, 1) determining the value of the expansion rate in the autoregressive coefficient.}

\item{sigma}{A positive scalar indicating the standard deviation of the innovations.}

\item{seed}{An object specifying if and how the random number generator (rng)
should be initialized. Either NULL or an integer will be used in a call to
\code{set.seed} before simulation. If set, the value is saved as "seed" attribute
of the returned value. The default, NULL, will not change rng state, and
return .Random.seed as the "seed" attribute. Results are different between
the parallel and non-parallel option, even if they have the same seed.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of length n.

\description{
The following function generates a time series which switches from a martingale to a mildly explosive
process and then back to a martingale.
}
\details{
The data generating process is described by the following equation:
\deqn{X_t = X_{t-1}1\{t < \tau_e\}+ \delta_T X_{t-1}1\{\tau_e \leq t\leq \tau_f\} +
\left(\sum_{k=\tau_f+1}^t \epsilon_k + X_{\tau_f}\right) 1\{t > \tau_f\} + \epsilon_t 1\{t \leq \tau_f\}
}{X[t] = X[t-1] 1{t < te}+ \delta[T] * X[t-1] 1{te \le t \le tf} +
(\sum [k=tf+1]^t \epsilon[k] + X[tf]) 1{t > tf} + \epsilon[t] 1{t \le tf},}

where the autoregressive coefficient \eqn{\delta_T}{\delta[T]} is given by:

\deqn{\delta_T = 1 + cT^{-a}}{\delta[T] = 1 + c*T^{-a}}

with \eqn{c>0}, \eqn{\alpha \in (0,1)}{\alpha in (0,1)},
\eqn{\epsilon \sim iid(0, \sigma^2)}{\epsilon - iid(0, \sigma^2)} and
\eqn{X_{\tau_f} = X_{\tau_e} + X'}{X[tf] = X[te] + X'} with \eqn{X' = O_p(1)}{X'= 0p(1)},
\eqn{\tau_e = [T r_e]}{te = [T re]} dates the origination of the bubble,
and \eqn{\tau_f = [T r_f]}{tf = [T rf]} dates the collapse of the bubble.
During the pre- and post- bubble periods, \eqn{[1, \tau_e)}{[1, te)},
\eqn{X_t}{Xt} is a pure random walk process. During the bubble expansion period
\eqn{\tau_e, \tau_f]}{[te,tf]} becomes a mildly explosive process with expansion rate
given by the autoregressive coefficient \eqn{\delta_T}{\delta[T]}; and, finally
during the post-bubble period, \eqn{(\tau_f, \tau]}{(tf, t]}  \eqn{X_t}{Xt} reverts to a martingale.
